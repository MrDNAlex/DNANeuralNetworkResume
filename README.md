# DNANeuralNetworkResume

A Android and Apple Unity Game/Project that hosts 3 Neural Network models trained on recognizing handwritten digits

The Models and the framework used to train them were both self developped and later upgraded to run guesses on the GPU and also train on the GPU.

The latest model is trained on the GPU with over 250 000 unique handdrawn digits for over 1 hour. Each epochj taking around 5 mins.

App is available on Google Play and Apple App Store under the name "Neural Network Experiments"
